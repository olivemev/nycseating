In this dataset there is information pertaining to the borough of Manhattan and it's public seating options. Other column values include exact location and type of seating or 'rest' option. 


## Description of the Data and file structure

The data in the 'data' folder contains the original csv files downloaded from NYC Open Data, https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/
Using the language Python, with a Jupyter notebook, I have created two new csv files to reflect my borough of interest, Manhattan. The new csvs are stored in the folder titled 'results.'

The shape of the data has been scaled down for easier viewing and sorting purposes. I removed over half of the columns from the original csv's in order to be able to see the important information more easily. 

I chose to keep information such as the BID or 'Business Improvement District' just in case but after some consideration  I found that it did not prove material to my exploratory analysis.
